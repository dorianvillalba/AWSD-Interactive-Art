# Arduino-Controlled Virtual Art Exhibit

This unique project combines the worlds of art, technology, and interaction. It offers a virtual art exhibit featuring a bird within a frame that can be controlled via 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys or an Arduino controller, offering two versions of interaction.

## Overview

Experience art like never before with this Arduino-controlled virtual art exhibit. You can control a bird within a frame, adding a layer of interaction to the visual appreciation of art.

## Features

**Current Features:**

1. **Interactive Artwork:** The interactive bird within a frame adds a layer of depth and engagement to the exhibit.
2. **Dual Control Options:** The exhibit offers two versions for controlling the bird: 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys for the keyboard version and an Arduino controller for the hardware version (Alternate Version Availalble in Repository)

## Installation

To run this exhibit locally:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
